## **Overview**  
**Sustainopolis** is an interactive "choose your own adventure" style game designed to educate players on the **United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. Players step into the role of a city leader tasked with shaping the future of a fictional city by making critical policy decisions across three key factors:  

- **Environmental Sustainability**  
- **Economic Prosperity**  
- **Social Equity**  

Each decision dynamically impacts the city’s development and leads to multiple possible outcomes, challenging players to balance competing priorities for a sustainable and prosperous future.
